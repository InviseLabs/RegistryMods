# RegistryMods
A collection of registry mods @MikeLierman is releasing to help enhance your workflow or solve tech problems.

## Register & Unregister DLLs as Admin Right Click Elevated CMD
### This adds "Register (As Admin)" and "Unregister (As Admin)" to Right Click Context Menu of DLL and OCX files in Windows 10 / Windows 11. Tested on both.
Download: RegisterDllAdminRightClick.reg or UnregisterDLLAdminRightClick.reg
Modified "Have Both" version allows both Register and Unregister as right click option, but you give up the modern Windows 11 right click

## Open Windows Terminal as Admin Right Click
### Adds "Open in Windows Terminal (as Admin)"
